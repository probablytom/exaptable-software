<!--preamble

This essay is intended to calcify some of my thoughts on what
good, exaptable engineering looks like, as well as why exaptability
is a desirable trait for any engineer. It's aimed at software
engineers — because software engineering is my background — but I
believe that the points I'm trying to make here apply to any creative,
and particularly, apply to anybody creating things which operate in
some way. That means that, in theory, the concepts here apply to
mechanical engineering, or to design, or to writing, too — all of these
crafts produce artefacts which we don't just consume, but use to
create other things. While exaptation isn't always our aim in any of
these fields, it *is* an important goal to bear in mind.

# Exaptable Engineering



# Learning from Others

## Art 

## Design 
<!-- I'm sure Dan Hill talks about this somewhere -->

## Mechanical Engineering
<!-- A hammer is an excellent tool. -->

<!-- Car repair & what happens as a car's constituent parts become
more complex / less exaptable -->

# The potential of exaptable engineering

<!-- With a focus on software? -->

# The UNIX philosophy and microservices

## Software as a cheap creative medium
<!-- Software makes it really cheap to build things. -->

## Computing's exaptable past
<!-- The UNIX philosophy -->

## Computing's exaptable future
<!-- Microservices -->
